					C is a procedural programming language.
					It was initially developed by Dennis 
					Ritchie as a system programming 
					language to write operating system. 
					The main features of C language include
					low-level access to memory, simple set 
					of keywords, and clean style, these 
					features make C language suitable for
					system programming like operating system 
					or compiler development.

				Java has been one of the most 
				popular programming language 
				for many years. Java is Object 
				Oriented. However it is not 
				considered as pure object oriented
				as it provides support for primitive
				data types (like int, char, etc) The
				Java codes are first compiled into byte
				code (machine independent code). Then
				the byte code is run on Java Virtual
				Machine (JVM) regardless of the
				underlying architecture.
